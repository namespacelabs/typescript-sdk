/**
 * ComputeService allows the creation, and management of compute instances.
 * Compute instances are micro-vm backed environments which boot very quickly
 * and are optimized to run containers.
 *
 * ## Access
 *
 * ComputeService is segregated into isolated regions for fault tolerance.
 * Each of the regional API endpoints offers a view into the compute instances
 * running at that location. Reach out to Namespace team at support@namespace.so
 * for a list of available regions.
 *
 * ```
 * https://{region}.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
 * # E.g.:
 * https://eu.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
 * https://us.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
 * ```
 *
 * See [the overview](https://buf.build/namespace/cloud) for examples accessing
 * the API from the console.
 *
 * ## Authentication
 *
 * Calls to the ComputeService require a *tenant token* or a *workload token*
 * passed as a Bearer token as part of each call. These are always required.
 *
 * A *tenant token* identifies both the workspace that the call operates on, but
 * may also constrain the set of actions that the caller may do.
 *
 * A *workload token* identifies a running instance, and the workspace it is
 * running in. Each running instance has a workload token, which is
 * automatically made available to services running inside the instance.
 *
 * A *tenant token* can be obtained using the
 * [IAM API](https://buf.build/namespace/cloud/docs/main:namespace.cloud.iam.v1beta).
 *
 * ## Guest services
 *
 * Managed guest services such as docker that are deployed and managed by
 * Namespace are reachable using the corresponding standard APIs, through the
 * public internet.
 *
 * Because these services typically don't support Namespace-based encapsulation,
 * a client-side proxy is used to transport the application-specific protocol
 * over the Namespace's public ingress, into the instance.
 *
 * To facilitate communication, the main underlying mechanism to transport the
 * application-specific protocol is WebSockets over HTTPS.
 *
 * ### Example: using the Docker API
 *
 * To call the Docker API remotely, first obtain the Docker public endpoint by
 * querying the set of running Services, using the DescribeInstance call.
 *
 * Iterate over `metadata.services` until finding an entry with `name=docker`.
 *
 * Establish an HTTPS connection to the contained `endpoint`, and upgrade it to
 * a WebSocket. To authenticate your request include an authentication token
 * (see Authentication) in the `x-nsc-ingress-auth` header.
 *
 * If connecting using a browser, where setting headers is not possible, you can
 * instead construct a URL using the base endpoint, and passing
 * `x-nsc-ingress-auth` as a query string argument.
 *
 * After the WebSocket is established, any frames received or sent of type
 * BinaryMessage carry application-specific payload.

    /**
     * Creates a new instance. Instances are micro-vm backed environments which
     * are optimized to run containers. Each instance is deployed with
     * `containerd`, and with optionally `dockerd` and Kubernetes.
     *
     * Instances can run one or more containers. Containers can be started using
     * one of two mechanisms:
     * - Namespace managed containers: containers are specified at creation time
     *   via the `containers` field, or at runtime via the `StartContainers`
     *   method. Managed containers have logs and metrics automatically
     *   collected, and Namespace's infrastructure optimizes future startup time
     *   of repeated use of the same containers. These containers are handled as
     *   "critical" and their lifetime is tied to the VMs -- if they fail,
     *   either due to early exit, OOM, etc, the instance also fails. Namespace
     *   managed containers are always run on containerd directly, in the
     *   `default` namespace.
     *
     * - User-managed containers: after an instance is created, you can use the
     *   containerd or Docker APIs to create and manage containers yourself.
     *   These containers are not marked required, so it's up to a user to take
     *   action to terminate a VM on container failure.
     *
     *
     * Instances that are running can be accessed via the region ingress.
     * Endpoints per exposed service are returned as part of the instance
     * creation. For example, proxies are exposed that allow direct access to
     * `containerd`, `docker`, etc services which are usually only exposed over
     * Unix sockets.
     *
     * The creation of an instance produces a set of metadata: InstanceMetadata
     * is also available in ListInstances requests, but the remainder of
     * metadata (e.g. extended metadata) is only available at creation time, or
     * if DescribeInstance is called.
     *
     * Instance creation is non-blocking. After an instance is created call
     * WaitInstance to observe the states instance creation goes through.
     *
     * ### Errors
     * - If the workspace is out of resources, a `ResourceExhausted` status is
     *   returned.
     * - If the request refers to an invalid argument, e.g. a non-existing
     *   region, an `InvalidArgument` status is returned.
